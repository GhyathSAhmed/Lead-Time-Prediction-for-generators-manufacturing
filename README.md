# Lead Time Prediction for Generator Manufacturing

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict lead times for
power generator manufacturing at **AQT Generators**. As a quality and
procurement engineer, the goal is to improve lead time estimation accuracy and
enhance customer communication through data-driven predictions.

## The Problem

AQT Generators is a 3-year-old company facing significant challenges with lead
time estimation:

- **Inconsistent estimates** provided to customers
- **Lack of infrastructure** to calculate accurate process times
- **Distributed operations** across multiple manufacturing locations
- **Outsourced work** components that complicate lead time calculations

## Our Solution

We are using **AutoML (Automated Machine Learning)** to develop a predictive
model that learns from historical manufacturing data and accounts for the
complex factors affecting lead times:

- Multi-location production processes
- External supplier timelines
- Varying production conditions
- Historical lead time patterns

## Why AutoML?

Given AQT's complex manufacturing environment, AutoML is ideal because it:

1. Learns from actual historical timelines rather than theoretical process times
2. Incorporates location-based variables across distributed operations
3. Handles missing or incomplete data
4. Automatically discovers non-obvious patterns in the data
