# Domain Research: Lead Time Prediction for Generator Manufacturing

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict lead times for
power generator manufacturing at AQT Generators. As a quality and procurement
engineer, the goal is to improve lead time estimation accuracy and customer communication.

## Business Context

**Company:** AQT Generators (3 years old)

**Problem Statement:**

- Inconsistent and inaccurate lead time estimates provided to customers
- Lack of infrastructure to calculate process times accurately
- Distributed manufacturing locations without centralized data
- Outsourced work components complicate lead time calculations

## Solution Approach

**Technology:** AutoML (Automated Machine Learning)

**Rationale:**
Given the complexity of AQT's manufacturing environment, an ML-based predictive
model can learn patterns from historical data and account for the various
factors affecting lead time, including:

- Multi-location processes
- Outsourced component timelines
- Varying production conditions
- Historical lead time data

## Key Challenges Addressed

1. **Lack of Standardized Process Documentation** - ML can learn from actual
   historical timelines rather than relying on theoretical process times
2. **Distributed Operations** - Model can incorporate location-based variables
3. **Outsourced Work** - External supplier lead times can be included as features
4. **Data Gaps** - AutoML can handle missing or incomplete data
